    <!-- A big part of css is sizing as well as order when it comes to how things are placed. Id > class > regular selector (p/h1/h2/etc). Sizing is more on the pixels or percentages. Percentages are better for resizing based on the browser. Em is based on the browser's font size --Generally works the best for different sizing on different screens. Sizing is more consistent (em) but a little less intuitive than px.
    vw/vh: veiwport width or height. 1vw = 1% the viewport width. 50vh 50% viewport height. So thatâ€™s what <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> is doing? Making it scalable depending on device? Yes. Don't size fonts with this.
    You can add multiple fonts with font-family by adding a comma in between each font. If the first one doesn't work then the next one will try and so on and so forth.-->

    <!-- <p class="medium-font">This is a paragraph. The font for this paragraph should be 36px.</p> -->
    <!-- Better than ID's...use classes as we can have multiple classes in an element to be able to specify exactly what I want to do with each one specifically while keeping the main p 1st in the line. .JS-Text:not(p) creates whatever you want in the class but says NO to the p part of it in relation to the main.-->
